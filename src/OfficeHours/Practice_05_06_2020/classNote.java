custom class:

Attributes: instance variable

actions: instance methods

			eat(), sleep()...

instance variable: belongs to the object
each object has it's own copy

this: refers to object instances
this.: can access to the object instances

the only time we use this to call instance variable is when there is a local variable sharing the same name with instance
